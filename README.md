## Overview

One of your final projects can be a "Flowchart" style application that can lead a person down a [decision tree](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/125819383316124395/). 

You can build all sorts of useful applications with this model, from helping someone pick a major in college, to deciding whether you should have another cookie (yes. always.), to knowing whether your friend might need help, to all sorts of use-cases. That's what makes this type of project fun, once you get the framework of the code working, you can add your own content and help people make better decisions.

You can see a sample version of this application that will help you decide ["Should You Got Out Tonight"](https://blooming-forest-38924.herokuapp.com/quiz/1)

## Concept

[Flowcharts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart) or "Decision Trees" work by posing a question to a person and based on the answer they give, leading them to another question, until finally, you have a resolution.

For now, don't worry about the content or domain of your flow chart, you first have to implement the framework of code to handle this style of application.

## Framework

This Sinatra Application follows the MVC pattern. Your first job is to implement the models for this application.
